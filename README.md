# ARKDistributed
The replacement for the ARK Integrated Application Framework (IAF), the Distributed Application System (DAS)
offers a more modular and flexible approach to the ARK series. This system includes the same basic application
modules as the older IAF platform, but with a distributed and modular format designed to increase efficiency,
ease-of-use, and accessibility. This is designed for use as a library-based platform, with each module designed
to be used as an independent JARfile. This vastly decreases storage and CPU requirements for running and compiling
this platform, and provides an easier integration phase for new additions to the application library. Developed
alongside the ARK-Android platfom, the DAS offers easy integration across multiple OS architectures.
