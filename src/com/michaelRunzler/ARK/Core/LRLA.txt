Welcome, user!
As the developer of this program library, I sincerely hope that you will find it useful and convenient.
Before you proceed, however, there is a small matter that I must unfortunately present to you - 
that of the Licensing and Release of Liability Agreement, or LRLA. This is a small piece of 
legal documentation that is necessary to protect both of our legal rights, mine as a developer,
and yours as an end-user. Please, read it carefully - I know it has become an common habit to
simply scroll to the bottom and click 'Accept'. This is unfortunate, but understandable, considering
the climate of legal fanaticism that surrounds so many companies in this day and age. I have endeavored
to keep these terms short and to the point as much as I can. Particular attention should be given to Sections 2, 3, and 4.
Thank you for using this ARK-series application!
